It doesn't make copies for objects separately. usually we defined methods as a prototype method member rather than Prototype variable memeber

        // Creating a new Object using new keyword
        var lg = new Mobile();

        // It first checks if lg object have property a as it doesn't have it so it go to its prototype object pointed by __proto__ and ask him if he has property a as it has so finally we receive 10. This is how it works behind the browser and JS Engine is the responsible for this task
